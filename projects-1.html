            Canteen Food Reservation System with QR Code
          </h2>
          <hr />
          <h4>Project overview</h4>
          <p>
            The Canteen Food Reservation System with QR Code project aims to
            revolutionize the dining experience within educational institutions
            by introducing a modern and efficient ordering system. Developed in
            response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the
            project focuses on enhancing safety measures, improving order
            accuracy, and optimizing the overall canteen operations.
          </p>

          <h4>Objectives</h4>
          <p>
            The primary objective of implementing the Canteen Food Reservation
            System with QR Code is to streamline the process of ordering food
            from the canteen while adhering to pandemic-related health and
            safety protocols. The system aims to facilitate contactless ordering
            and minimize physical interaction in the canteen area, thereby
            reducing the risk of spreading infectious diseases.
          </p>

          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>
            In traditional canteen settings, students, faculty, and staff
            members often face challenges such as long queues, crowded spaces,
            and limited menu visibility. These issues have become more
            pronounced during the pandemic, where maintaining social distancing
            and ensuring health security are paramount concerns. Additionally,
            the manual order-taking process may lead to errors and delays,
            further exacerbating the situation.
          </p>

          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            The proposed solution is to develop a Canteen Food Reservation
            System equipped with QR Code technology. This system allows users to
            place food orders in advance using their smartphones or other
            devices. Upon arrival at the canteen, users can scan a unique QR
            Code assigned to their order, which will be displayed on their
            device screens. This process eliminates the need for physical menus,
            order slips, and cash transactions, thereby promoting a safer and
            more efficient dining experience.
          </p>

          <h4>Key Components</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="components-title"> Mobile Application: </span>
              A user-friendly mobile application serves as the interface for
              placing food orders, browsing the menu, and scheduling pickup
              times. The application is designed to be accessible to users of
              all technical backgrounds and compatible with various smartphone
              devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="components-title">Backend System: </span>
              A robust backend system manages order processing, inventory
              management, and user authentication. It facilitates seamless
              communication between the mobile application and the canteen
              staff, ensuring efficient order fulfillment and timely updates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="components-title">QR Code Integration: </span>QR Code
              technology is utilized to generate unique identifiers for each
              food order. These QR Codes contain essential order details,
              including menu items, preferences, and pickup times. Users present
              these QR Codes at the canteen for easy identification and
              retrieval of their orders.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Key Features</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="components-title">
                User registration and Authentication:
              </span>
              Users (students, faculty, and staff) can register and create
              accounts on the platform using their university credentials.
              Authentication ensures secure access to the system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="components-title">Menu Management: </span>The system
              provides an intuitive interface for canteen staff to manage the
              menu items available for reservation. They can update menu items,
              prices, and availability in real-time.
            </li>
